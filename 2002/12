If an average person on the subway turns to you, like an ancient mariner,
and starts telling you her tale, you turn away or nod and hope she stops,
not just because you fear she might be crazy.  If she tells her tale on
camera, you might listen.  Watching strangers on television, even
responding to them from a studio audience, we're disengaged - voyeurs
collaborating with exhibitionists in rituals of sham community.  Never
have so many known so much about people for whom they cared so little.

		   in "I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional".


Some scholars are like donkeys, they merely carry a lot of books.

Understanding is always the understanding of a smaller problem
in relation to a bigger problem.
		-- P. D. Ouspensky
