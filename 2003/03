president realizes it's time to promote one of them, but they're all so
competent that he's not sure which one to choose.  So he devises a little
test.  One day while they're all at lunch, he places $500 on each of their

in the market and returns $1,500 to him in the morning.  Who gets the
promotion?  The one with the big tits!

Hell nobody's perfect, would you like to play?
I feel together today!
