I don't need no drugs to calm me...

Don't think I need anything at all.
No!  Don't think I need anything at all!
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall.
		-- Pink Floyd, "Another Brick in the Wall", Part III

	In every restaurant, the hardness of the butter pats
	increases in direct proportion to the softness of the bread.
