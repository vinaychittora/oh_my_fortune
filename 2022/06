I love this fucking University, and this University loves fucking me.


I never killed a man that didn't deserve it.

O'Toole's commentary on Murphy's Law:
	Murphy was an optimist.


Happiness is twin floppies.


We may not like doctors, but at least they doctor.  Bankers are not ever
popular but at least they bank.  Policeman police and undertakers take
under.  But lawyers do not give us law.  We receive not the gladsome light
of jurisprudence, but rather precedents, objections, appeals, stays,
filings and forms, motions and counter-motions, all at $250 an hour.
		-- Nolo News, summer 1989


Happiness is a positive cash flow.
