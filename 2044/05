Coming together is a beginning;
	keeping together is progress;
		working together is success.


If we were meant to get up early, God would have created us
with alarm clocks.


Love thy neighbor, tune thy piano.


The work [of software development] is becoming far easier (i.e. the tools
we're using work at a higher level, more removed from machine, peripheral
and operating system imperatives) than it was twenty years ago, and because
of this, knowledge of the internals of a system may become less accessible.
We may be able to dig deeper holes, but unless we know how to build taller
ladders, we had best hope that it does not rain much.
