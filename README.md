# FAQ

This repo is kind of weird. I've received a lot of questions about it, and so I
thought I would try to clear things up a bit.

## How are you committing every day? 

While there are commits every day, they've already been made through year 2069.
GitHub merely thinks they may have just happened, because git.

## How were you using git in the 1970's?

The real question is, why doesn't git handle pre-epoch time?

## It's kind of offensive, isn't it?

I hope so, otherwise -o is a lie. To quote FreeBSD's
[FORTUNE(6)](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/usr.bin/fortune):

     -o      Choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms.  Please,
             please, please request a potentially offensive fortune if and
             only if you believe, deep down in your heart, that you are will-
             ing to be offended.  (And that if you are not willing, you will
             just quit using -o rather than give us grief about it, okay?)

                   ... let us keep in mind the basic governing philosophy
                   of The Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words:
                   we believe in healthy, hearty laughter -- at the expense of
                   the whole human race, if needs be.
                   Needs be.

## Cute. So really, what's the deal?

I was curious how GitHub would deal with irrational time. Would my "Longest
streak" be 46 years, or 100? (46 years, or 17,000 or so days). How would it
deal with future commits? (it considers all future events "just now"). In other
words, it was just for the fun of being able to confidently say that I have the
longest GitHub streak in the world, even if it is contrived.
